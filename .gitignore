## Ignore Atmel Studio temporary files and build results
# http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/

# Atmel Studio is powered by an older version of Visual Studio,
# so most of the project and solution files are the same as VS files,
# only prefixed by an `at`.

#Build Directories

*.eep

*.hex

#User Specific Files
